#OVERVIEW

TCP Server-Client System for Recommending Walks and Selling Books
This project is a TCP server-client system developed to recommend walks from a set of walking books and allow walkers to purchase these books. The server accepts requests from the client with specific parameters and returns the recommended walks from the set of walking books.

The client can also purchase the books containing the recommended walks. The server calculates the cost of the books, and the client can see the price on the screen. The server also handles backorders if there are insufficient copies of the books available.

This project was developed using python. The system is built on a TCP server-client architecture.

# PERFORMANCE
This TCP server-client system is designed to recommend walks and sell books to walkers. The system is easy to use and can provide walkers with a customized list of walks that meet their specific requirements. Additionally, the system can sell books that contain the recommended walks and handle backorders if there are not sufficient copies of the books available.
